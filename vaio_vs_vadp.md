## 🥊 **VAIO vs. VADP: Quick Summary**

| Feature                      | VAIO (vSphere APIs for I/O Filtering)                            | VADP (vStorage APIs for Data Protection)                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What it is                   | Framework for filtering/modifying I/O at hypervisor layer        | Snapshot-based data protection APIs for backup/restore       |
| Introduced in                | vSphere 6.0                                                      | vSphere 4.x                                                  |
| Works at                     | Inline with VM disk I/O (before/after hitting storage)           | Uses VMware snapshots to capture VM state and access VMDKs   |
| Main use cases               | Backup, replication, caching, encryption, deduplication (inline) | Backup, restore, deduplication (snapshot-based)              |
| Third-party integration      | Requires vendor-developed I/O filters using VAIO framework       | Backup software connects via VADP to take and read snapshots |
| Performance impact           | Low — no snapshots, intercepts only necessary I/O                | Higher — snapshots can stun VMs, increase disk change rate   |
| Typical vendors using it     | Cohesity, Veeam (advanced features), Dell, Zerto, caching tools  | Almost all backup vendors (Veeam, Commvault, Veritas, etc.)  |
| Granularity                  | Per-write or per-read I/O filtering                              | Per-snapshot block-level access                              |
| Reliance on VMware snapshots | No                                                               | Yes                                                          |

— **VAIO vs. VADP** is something VMware pros often ask about because they **both help with data protection**, but they work in very different ways.

Let’s break it down:

### 🔍 **What’s the core difference?**

✅ **VAIO** = sits *inline* in the ESXi hypervisor’s I/O stack.
It lets tools hook directly into **live read/write operations** without needing snapshots. That’s why it’s super useful for continuous replication, caching, and encryption.

✅ **VADP** = snapshot-based API.
Backup tools use it to **create snapshots** of the VM, then access the VMDK data for backup or restore. It’s been the standard VMware backup method for years.

---

### 💡 **Why was VAIO created if VADP already existed?**

Because snapshots **have limits**:

* They can increase storage usage.
* They can cause VM stun on delete.
* They don’t work well for continuous operations (e.g., continuous replication, inline caching).

VAIO solves these by **bypassing the snapshot system entirely** and allowing real-time data handling.

### 🏗 **When do you use VAIO over VADP?**

| Scenario                                   | Use VAIO? | Use VADP? |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Standard VM backups (nightly, weekly)      | ❌         | ✅         |
| Continuous replication (RPO \~seconds)     | ✅         | ❌         |
| Inline caching (flash accelerators)        | ✅         | ❌         |
| Encrypted writes at hypervisor layer       | ✅         | ❌         |
| Snapshot-based full or incremental backups | ❌         | ✅         |

---

### ⚠ **Important Compatibility Note**

* **VADP**-based tools usually work **out-of-the-box** in VMware without extra modules.
* **VAIO**-based tools **require** you to install the vendor’s I/O filter plug-ins and register them in vCenter.

That’s why VAIO-based solutions often need more careful upgrade/compatibility checks.

* **(1) VAIO:** Intercepts and filters VM I/O requests inline at the hypervisor kernel level before they reach storage.
* **(3) VADP:** Works via vCenter to manage snapshots and changed blocks for backups; no inline I/O filtering.

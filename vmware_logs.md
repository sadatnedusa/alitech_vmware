### üõ† **How to Access ESXi Logs**

‚úÖ **Via SSH:**

1. SSH into ESXi host.
2. Navigate to logs:

   ```bash
   cd /var/log
   ```
3. Use `cat`, `tail`, `less`, or `grep`:

   ```bash
   tail -f vmkernel.log
   grep -i vaio vmkernel.log
   ```

‚úÖ **Via vSphere Client (GUI):**

* Go to **Host ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Logs**.
* You can view live logs directly in the interface.

‚úÖ **Via ESXi Direct Console (DCUI):**

* Use **F2 ‚Üí View System Logs**.
* Browse logs from the console if network access is unavailable.

‚úÖ **Export Logs (Support Bundle):**

* In vSphere Client:

  * Host ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Export System Logs ‚Üí Select desired components.
* Creates a `.tgz` file with all logs packaged, useful for vendor support.

### üîç **What Logs Help with VAIO or VADP Issues?**

| **Issue Type**                   | **Check These Logs**                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| VAIO filter load/attach failures | vmkernel.log, hostd.log, vpxa.log, vmware.log (per VM) |
| Backup failures (VADP)           | vmware.log (per VM), hostd.log, vpxa.log               |
| Storage path or I/O errors       | vmkernel.log, vmkwarning.log, vobd.log                 |
| Snapshots or consolidation       | hostd.log, vmware.log (per VM), vpxa.log               |
| Module or VIB issues             | esxupdate.log, vmkernel.log, loadESX.log               |
| HA/DRS problems                  | fdm.log, vpxa.log                                      |

### üìã **Example Commands**

‚úÖ Watch live VAIO filter activity:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/vmkernel.log | grep -i vaio
```

‚úÖ Check for backup snapshot issues:

```bash
grep -i snapshot /var/log/hostd.log
```

‚úÖ Look for device or path errors:

```bash
grep -i naa /var/log/vmkernel.log
```

‚úÖ Check per-VM logs:

```bash
cat /vmfs/volumes/<datastore>/<vm>/<vm>.log
```

### ‚ö† **Pro Tip**

If your environment has a centralized log collector (like vRealize Log Insight, Splunk, or ELK), configure ESXi‚Äôs **remote syslog**:

* Configure with:

  ```bash
  esxcli system syslog config set --loghost='udp://<log-server>:514'
  esxcli system syslog reload
  ```

This helps you **retain logs** even if the host reboots or the local log files rotate.

‚úÖ A **log review checklist**
‚úÖ A **custom grep script** to scan for known issues
‚úÖ A **PowerCLI one-liner** to pull logs from multiple hosts


### A detailed explanation of the **ESXi Log Review Checklist** you selected:

---

### When to Use This Checklist

This checklist is designed for troubleshooting common ESXi issues such as:

* VAIO (VMware I/O filters) problems
* Backup or snapshot failures (often related to VADP or third-party backup tools)
* Storage or network path errors (like SAN connectivity or multipathing problems)
* VM power or performance problems
* Host communication or management agent failures (issues between ESXi host and vCenter or within ESXi itself)

### Step 1: Prepare the Environment

Before diving into logs, make sure you have access to the ESXi host via SSH or console because many logs are only accessible there. Also:

* Identify which VMs, hosts, datastores, or networks are affected‚Äîthis focuses your log review.
* Confirm how logs are retained; ESXi log files rotate and can be overwritten on reboot, so act quickly or export logs.
* Optionally export system logs through vSphere Client or CLI if you plan to escalate to VMware support.


### Step 2: Identify Relevant Logs

ESXi creates several key logs, each focused on a different component:

* **vmkernel.log**: The core hypervisor log‚Äîstorage, networking, I/O, driver and module errors.
* **hostd.log**: Logs host management activities like VM power events, snapshots, backups.
* **vpxa.log**: Tracks communication between ESXi and vCenter Server.
* **fdm.log**: Records vSphere HA (High Availability) related events and failovers.
* **vobd.log & vmkwarning.log**: Logs hardware alerts and critical warnings.
* **Per-VM logs**: Located in each VM‚Äôs folder, these track VM-specific events like device connections or snapshots.
* **esxupdate.log**: Shows patching or update operations on the host.
* **shell.log**: Tracks SSH or console session activities.

### Step 3: Review Core Logs

Systematically review logs based on the problem area:

* Look in **vmkernel.log** for errors related to storage paths, networking issues, or module loading failures.
* Check **hostd.log** for problems with VM power operations, snapshots, or backups.
* Use **vpxa.log** to find communication issues between host and vCenter.
* Inspect **vobd.log** for hardware alerts like disk or network failures.
* Check **fdm.log** for HA failover or cluster-related problems.
* For VM-specific issues, check the VM‚Äôs own log file.

### Step 4: Use Focused Searches

To quickly pinpoint issues, use targeted `grep` commands:

* For VAIO filter problems: `grep -i vaio /var/log/vmkernel.log`
* For backup or snapshot failures: `grep -i snapshot /var/log/hostd.log`
* For storage path or device errors: `grep -i naa /var/log/vmkernel.log` or `grep -i dead /var/log/vmkernel.log` (dead paths indicate connectivity issues)
* For host-agent communication errors: `grep -i error /var/log/vpxa.log`
* For HA failover events: `grep -i failover /var/log/fdm.log`
* For VM-specific errors: `grep -i error /vmfs/volumes/<datastore>/<vm>/<vm>.log`

### Summary

This checklist helps you organize log analysis effectively by:

1. Setting up proper access and context
2. Knowing which logs to check
3. Reviewing them methodically
4. Using focused searches to narrow down causes

It‚Äôs a practical, stepwise approach to solve ESXi troubleshooting scenarios, especially for storage, backup, and communication issues.

## A handy **PowerCLI one-liner** that pulls specified ESXi logs from multiple hosts and saves them locally. This example grabs the `vmkernel.log` and `hostd.log` from each host‚Äôs `/var/log/` directory via SSH/SCP.

---

### Prerequisites:

* PowerCLI installed on your machine
* SSH enabled on ESXi hosts
* You have SSH credentials for ESXi hosts
* Your PowerShell environment allows SCP (e.g., via `scp` command or you can use `PSCP` from PuTTY)

### PowerCLI One-Liner Example

```powershell
# Define variables
$esxiHosts = Get-VMHost  # Or use an array of hostnames/IPs, e.g. @("esxi01","esxi02")
$logFiles = @("vmkernel.log", "hostd.log")
$localFolder = "C:\ESXiLogs"

# Create local folder if not exists
if (-not (Test-Path $localFolder)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $localFolder }

# Loop through hosts and copy logs using SCP
foreach ($host in $esxiHosts) {
    foreach ($log in $logFiles) {
        $remotePath = "/var/log/$log"
        $localPath = Join-Path $localFolder "$($host.Name)_$log"
        Write-Host "Copying $log from $($host.Name)..."
        
        # Using SCP command (assumes you have key-based auth or password-less SCP setup)
        # If you need password auth, consider using PSCP with stored creds or interactive input
        scp "root@$($host.Name):$remotePath" $localPath
    }
}
```

### How this works:

* Gets all ESXi hosts connected in your vCenter (`Get-VMHost`)
* For each host, downloads the two logs from `/var/log/` via SCP
* Saves logs locally, naming files by host + log name to avoid overwrites

### Notes:

* Replace `root` with your ESXi SSH username if different
* If SCP command isn‚Äôt recognized in PowerShell, you may need to install it or use PuTTY‚Äôs `pscp.exe` instead
* For large environments or automated scripts, consider integrating with `Invoke-SSHCommand` PowerShell modules or VMware APIs for better control and authentication handling

### A simple but effective **custom Bash grep script** to scan ESXi logs for common known issues like VAIO errors, snapshot problems, storage path errors, and more.

---

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Custom ESXi Log Scan Script
# Scans key ESXi logs for common known issues and prints summaries

LOG_DIR="/var/log"
VM_DIR="/vmfs/volumes"

echo "=== Starting ESXi Log Scan ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
echo ""

# Define logs and search patterns
declare -A search_patterns=(
  ["VAIO Errors"]="vaio"
  ["Snapshot/Backup Issues"]="snapshot|backup"
  ["Storage Path Errors"]="naa|dead|timeout|pathdown"
  ["Host-Agent Communication Errors"]="vpxa.*error|vpxa.*fail|hostd.*error"
  ["HA Failover Events"]="failover|fdm"
  ["Hardware Alerts"]="vobd|temperature|fan|power"
)

# Scan vmkernel.log for multiple issues
echo "Scanning vmkernel.log..."
for pattern in "vaio" "naa|dead|timeout|pathdown"; do
  echo "--- Pattern: $pattern ---"
  grep -iE "$pattern" "$LOG_DIR/vmkernel.log" | tail -20
  echo ""
done

# Scan hostd.log for snapshot and backup issues
echo "Scanning hostd.log..."
grep -iE "snapshot|backup" "$LOG_DIR/hostd.log" | tail -20
echo ""

# Scan vpxa.log for host-agent communication errors
echo "Scanning vpxa.log..."
grep -iE "error|fail" "$LOG_DIR/vpxa.log" | tail -20
echo ""

# Scan fdm.log for HA failover events
echo "Scanning fdm.log..."
grep -i "failover" "$LOG_DIR/fdm.log" | tail -20
echo ""

# Scan vobd.log for hardware alerts
echo "Scanning vobd.log..."
grep -iE "temperature|fan|power|failure|error" "$LOG_DIR/vobd.log" | tail -20
echo ""

# Optional: scan all VM logs for errors (warning: can be slow)
read -p "Scan all VM logs for errors? (y/n): " scan_vm
if [[ "$scan_vm" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
  echo "Scanning VM logs for errors..."
  find "$VM_DIR" -name "*.log" -exec grep -i "error" {} \; | tail -40
  echo ""
fi

echo "=== ESXi Log Scan Complete ==="
```


### How to use this script:

1. Save it as `esxi_log_scan.sh` on your ESXi host or a management Linux box with access to ESXi logs.
2. Make executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x esxi_log_scan.sh
   ```
3. Run it:

   ```bash
   ./esxi_log_scan.sh
   ```

It prints out recent (last 20 lines) matching entries for common problem patterns, helping you quickly identify issues.
